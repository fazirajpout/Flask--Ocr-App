     We are using python-tesseract which is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.
     It is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
     Additionally, if used as a script, it will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.
